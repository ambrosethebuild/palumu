## Components
### FloatingViewHelper

![](https://github.com/ivanisidrowu/palumu/blob/master/demo/palumu-floating.gif)

Here is an example of how to create a floating view above a RecyclerView
```kotlin
val floatingViewHelper = FloatingViewHelper()
floatingViewHelper.floatingView = floatingPlayer
floatingViewHelper.recyclerView = recyclerView
floatingViewHelper.listener = listener
```
The listener is needed for helper to get the view followed by floating view.
Please make sure you override getTargetView() in FloatingViewListener.

Then, you attach the view and start the helper.
```kotlin
floatingViewHelper.attachFloatingView()
floatingViewHelper.start()
```

Fullscreen is supported.

![](https://github.com/ivanisidrowu/palumu/blob/master/demo/palumu-list-fullscreen.gif)

```kotlin
// Enter fullscreen (use it in activity onConfigurationChanged)
floatingViewHelper.enterFullScreen()

// Leave fullscreen (use it in activity onConfigurationChanged)
floatingViewHelper.leaveFullScreen()
```
Other details could be found in ![wiki](https://github.com/ivanisidrowu/palumu/wiki/Document). You can also refer to ![the sample APP](https://github.com/ivanisidrowu/palumu/tree/master/app/src/main).

### ScalablePageFrame

This class provides youtubish style view. It can be scaled and swipe-to-close. You can set head view as the upper part of the UI and body view as lower part of the UI. In general, you can set any views to head and body. But SurfaceView now is not supported.

Add the frame into the specified view.
```kotlin
val videoPageFrame = ScalablePageFrame(context)
videoPageFrame.init(headView, bodyView, root)
```
It also supports fullscreen, just add few lines of code into onConfigurationChanged.

```kotlin
// Enter fullscreen (use it in activity onConfigurationChanged)
videoPageFrame?.enterFullScreen()
// Leave fullscreen (use it in activity onConfigurationChanged)
videoPageFrame?.leaveFullScreen()
```
